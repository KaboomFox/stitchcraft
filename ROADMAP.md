# Roadmap status

The plan, with every step and its done-criteria, is in [docs/src/plan/roadmap.md](docs/src/plan/roadmap.md).
This file is the status board: update it in the same PR that completes a step.

**Where we are (2026-10-08):** M1's code and docs are done: StitchCraft writes PES and DST files, the
reference pages are generated from the code, and the MC-1 test sheets (TS-01, TS-02, TS-10A/B/C) are out
for sewing on the reference machine. M2 is under way: StitchCraft reads PES, PEC and DST files back
(`stitch inspect`), every writer/reader pair round-trips, pinned pyembroidery cross-checks every golden
file, `stitch preview` draws exactly what will sew, `stitch convert` moves designs between PES and DST,
the docs show generated pictures of every test sheet, and the readers are fuzzed for an hour every night.
Public APIs, line coverage and mutation testing now have recorded baselines that only move one way. M2
is complete. M3 is under way: every parameter is declared once and its reference page, JSON Schema and
Ink/Stitch-contract status are generated from that declaration; every diagnostic code has a case;
StitchCraft reads SVG files into its design model, reporting whatever it leaves out; and the engine
stitches running stitches: even spacing between corners, patterns of lengths, curves followed within the
tolerance, no stitch shorter than the shortest stitch, measured straight, repeats, bean stitch and random
length, manual stitches placed by hand, and lock stitches of every shape at either end of the
stitching. It assembles a design's elements into one plan, with jumps, trims, stops, thread changes and
locks where `ties` says, and fits the plan to the machine. `stitch plan design.svg -o design.pes` takes an
SVG of strokes to a machine file, with a preview and a report. `stitch bug-report` writes one file that
reproduces a problem, and `stitch plan` writes one by itself when StitchCraft finds a bug in itself. The
conformance report shows every active requirement green. Next are the sew-out reports for MC-1, which
closes M1, and for MC-2, which closes M3. The MC-2 sheets are drawn as designs and planned by the engine.
M4's steps are done. A satin column's path is read as its rails and rungs, or made into them from its
centre line, and its underlays and top stitches are sewn as Ink/Stitch sews them. M5 has begun: a fill's
region is built as the drawing shows it, and its tatami rows and their needle points lie where Ink/Stitch
puts them. The MC-3 kit sews satin columns of every width from 1 to 10 mm, and
each underlay side by side. The reference machine is a Brother PE800 (ADR 0013), with a profile for each
of its 3 hoops, and TS-02, TS-02B and TS-10 are redrawn to fit them.
The repository is
[KaboomFox/stitchcraft](https://github.com/KaboomFox/stitchcraft), with the docs published at
[kaboomfox.github.io/stitchcraft](https://kaboomfox.github.io/stitchcraft/) and `main` protected; the
open owner action from M0.5 is the code-of-conduct contact.

| Milestone | Scope | Status | Machine checkpoint |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 | Foundations and guardrails | 🟡 M0.1–M0.4, M0.9 and M0.10 done; M0.5 partly (repository, owner, labels, Pages, branch protection; code-of-conduct contact open); M0.6–M0.8 open | — |
| M1 | Stitch plan, Brother profile, PES/DST writers, test sheets | 🟡 M1.1 to M1.10 done, and M1 closes with MC-1 | MC-1 🟡 kit out for sewing (TS-02 and TS-10 redrawn for the PE800) |
| M2 | Readers, preview renderer, fuzzing | 🟢 M2.1–M2.8 done | — |
| M3 | Running stitch family, plan assembly, SVG input | 🟡 M3.1 to M3.10 done (parameter registry, a case for every diagnostic code, SVG input, running stitch, repeats and bean stitch, manual stitch, lock stitches, plan assembly, finalize and `stitch plan`, bug-report bundles). M3 closes with MC-2. | MC-2 🟡 kit ready for sewing (TS-02B, TS-03, TS-04) |
| M4 | Satin column | 🟡 M4.1 to M4.9 done. Satin columns are sewn with their underlays and start and end at their nearest points. Their top stitches are placed, compensated, inset on curves and split, as in Ink/Stitch. A column drawn as one path is as wide as its stroke. It is sewn between rails made from its centre line, or as a stroke when too narrow to stitch across. MC-3's sew-out closes M4 | MC-3 🟡 kit ready for sewing (TS-05, TS-06) |
| M5 | Tatami fill | 🟡 M5.1 to M5.3 done. A fill's region is built as the drawing shows it under its fill rule, and parts too small to sew are left out with a warning. Its rows, and the needle points along them, lie where Ink/Stitch puts them. Fills are sewn from M5.4 on | MC-4 ⚪ |
| M6 | VectorCraft plug-in (ABI v1), export from `.vectorcraft`, compatibility gate | ⚪ | MC-5 ⚪ |
| M7 | Zigzag/E/S stitches, contour, meander, circular fills | ⚪ | MC-6 ⚪ |
| M8 | Ink/Stitch SVG interoperability, differential testing | ⚪ | — |
| M10 | Guided, gradient, ripple, tartan, cross stitch; routing tools | ⚪ | — |
| M11 | EXP, JEF, VP3, XXX, U01; thread catalogues | ⚪ | — |
| M12 | 1.0: performance, docs audit, translations, release automation | ⚪ | MC-7 ⚪ |
| M9 | VectorCraft ABI v2 (upstream RFC), last: after 1.0 and the work after it | ⚪ | none |
