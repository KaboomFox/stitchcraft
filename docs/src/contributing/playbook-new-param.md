# Playbook: add or change a parameter

1. **Name it.** If Ink/Stitch has the same parameter, use its attribute name and meaning, and the default
   it sews for a file that sets none ([naming rules](../design/params.md#naming-rules)). Otherwise follow
   the same style.
2. **Declare it** in the generator's `params!` block: kind, default (written as a design stores it),
   range or options, section, visibility condition, origin, and the doc comment — the help users will
   read, so write it for an embroiderer and mention the visible effect. A new declaration (a new
   `…Params` struct) also gets one line in `stitchcraft_engine::registry::PARAMETERS` and its generated
   page a line in `docs/src/SUMMARY.md` (`cargo xtask docs --check` says which).
3. **Use it** through the typed struct; never read raw `ParamSet` values in a generator.
4. **Test it:** a conformance case where the parameter changes the result in the documented direction,
   plus a property test if it has a monotonic effect.
5. **Check limits:** the plug-in test fails if the family's VectorCraft manifest would exceed 64
   parameters, which every VectorCraft release takes. If it does, discuss moving rarely used parameters to a
   preset, or a group: VectorCraft 0.14 takes 256 parameters, 64 of them outside groups.
6. **Regenerate docs:** `cargo xtask docs` writes the reference page, the JSON Schema and the
   compatibility contract's StitchCraft column, and checks the declaration against the contract. An
   Ink/Stitch parameter needs a compatible type and the default Ink/Stitch sews, and a deliberate
   difference needs an entry in `conformance/deviations.toml`. Add a before/after shot if the effect is
   visual.
7. **Changing** an existing parameter's meaning, unit or default is a breaking change: add a migration
   and a case with old input, and a changelog line.
