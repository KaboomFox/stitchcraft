# SVG input

<!-- implements: crates/stitchcraft-svg/src/** -->

The SVG adapter, `stitchcraft-svg`, turns an SVG file into a [`Design`](data-model.md#engine-input-design-stitchcraft-engine)
and a list of warnings. It reads what an SVG viewer draws, in millimetres, and reports what it leaves
out. The engine never sees SVG ([architecture](architecture.md#hosts-ports-and-adapters)).

## What becomes an element

- **Shapes.** Each `<path>`, `<rect>`, `<circle>`, `<ellipse>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>` and `<polygon>`
  that paints becomes one element per paint. A fill becomes an area and a stroke becomes an outline.
  A `<line>` has no fill.
- **Order.** Elements follow document order, which is SVG's paint order and the sewing order. A
  shape's fill is sewn before its stroke, as Ink/Stitch sews them, and the outline covers the fill's edge.
  When `paint-order` paints the stroke first, `SC-W0802` says the fill is sewn first.
- **Groups.** `<g>`, `<a>` and the child a `<switch>` chooses pass their transform and style to their
  children.
- **Ids.** An element's id is `svg:<label>:fill` or `svg:<label>:stroke`. The label is the SVG
  element's `id`, or `<tag>@<n>` for the n-th element of that kind. A repeated id gets `~2`, `~3` and
  so on. The adapter's own diagnostics name the SVG element as `svg:<label>`.
- **Names.** An `inkscape:label` becomes the element's name.

## Geometry and units

- The root's `width`, `height`, `viewBox` and `preserveAspectRatio` map user units to millimetres. A
  user unit is a CSS pixel, 1/96 inch, unless they say otherwise.
- Transforms compose through every ancestor. The matrices use `stitchcraft_core::math`, so the result
  is the same on every platform ([determinism](determinism.md)).
- Path data is read as SVG viewers draw it, arcs included. An error in the data ends the path at the
  error.
- An arc becomes cubic curves as inkex, which Ink/Stitch reads files with, cuts it: in equal pieces, one
  more than the whole quarter turns it makes. Manual stitch puts a needle point on each piece's end, as
  Ink/Stitch's does. inkex counts the quarter turns in floating point, and its rounding can cut an arc of
  a whole number of quarter turns into one piece fewer (`DEV-SVG-002`).
- A `<circle>` or an `<ellipse>` starts at its top and goes round anticlockwise on screen, as inkex
  draws it, so a stroke round it starts and runs as Ink/Stitch's does.
- Positions are exact to within a micrometre (`REQ-SVG-001`). Any path data reads without failing the
  adapter, and fuzzing checks it (`REQ-SVG-002`).
- A length may have spaces around it. One that does not read is 0, as in a viewer, and `SC-W0804` names
  it.

## Colour and visibility

- `fill`, `stroke`, `color` and `currentColor` give the thread colour. A gradient gives its first colour
  and a pattern its fallback colour, each with a warning. A gradient of one colour, such as an Inkscape
  swatch, gives that colour without one.
- Colours read as editors write them. Keywords such as `currentcolor` may be in any case. An ICC colour
  after the sRGB one, which Inkscape's colour-managed picker writes, is left for the sRGB colour.
- A declaration that does not read gives way to the next one, as in CSS: the last valid one in `style`,
  else a valid presentation attribute. When none of an element's paints reads, the inherited paint
  stays, and `SC-W0802` names the value.
- `display: none` hides an element and everything in it. A hidden or fully transparent paint is left
  out, as a viewer leaves it out. The insides of `<defs>`, `<symbol>`, `<marker>`, `<pattern>`,
  `<clipPath>` and `<mask>` are never drawn.

## Stroke width and join

A stroke's width and join give a satin column drawn as one path its width and its corners
([single-path satin](algorithms/satin.md#single-path-satin)). Other strokes are sewn along their paths,
however wide they are drawn. Both are read as Ink/Stitch reads them (`REQ-SVG-004`).

- **Width.** The width is `stroke-width`, inherited, 1 user unit when nothing sets it. It is a length in
  the shape's own user units, as in a viewer, and a percentage is of the viewport's diagonal over √2.
  The transforms down to the shape scale it by the average of how far they stretch the x and y axes.
  That is exact when they scale both axes alike. Under an uneven scale or a skew, a viewer draws the
  stroke wider one way than the other, and the average is the middle way. The transforms scale a stroke
  with `vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke` too, as Ink/Stitch scales it, though a viewer does not.
- **Join.** `round` and `bevel` are read as they are named. A `miter` join is limited by
  `stroke-miterlimit`, 4 when nothing sets it, as SVG says. Any other join, or none, is a miter limited
  at 5, as in Ink/Stitch. SVG 2's `miter-clip` and `arcs` count as other joins.
- **Values that do not read.** A width, join or limit that does not read is ignored, as a viewer
  ignores it, and `SC-W0804` names it. A negative width and a limit below 1 do not read. A stroke too
  wide to measure, such as `1e308in`, is left out with `SC-W0804`. Its fill is still sewn.

Ink/Stitch reads a width in `%`, `em` or `ex` as 0, and a join written in capitals as no join at all. The
adapter reads them as a viewer draws them (`DEV-SVG-001`).

## Ink/Stitch objects

An Ink/Stitch SVG has 3 kinds of object that Ink/Stitch reads and does not sew. The adapter sews none of
them (`REQ-SVG-003`).

- **Commands.** The `trim` and `stop` commands turn on the object's `trim_after` and `stop_after`. The
  `ignore_object` and `ignore_layer` commands leave out an object or a layer, as the
  `inkstitch:ignore_object` setting does, and `SC-I0805` lists each object left out. The
  [command table](inkstitch-compat-contract.md#commands) gives what the adapter does with each of the
  12 commands.
- **Connectors** tie a command to its object.
- **Helper paths** have one of Ink/Stitch's start markers. They steer the stitches of other objects.

`SC-W0802` reports a connector that ties no command, a helper path, and a command that the adapter does
not apply yet. The module docs of `crates/stitchcraft-svg/src/inkstitch.rs` describe how the adapter
finds these objects, with the Ink/Stitch files they were read from.

## Design settings

Ink/Stitch keeps 3 settings for the whole design in the file's first `<metadata>` element:
`collapse_len_mm`, `min_stitch_len_mm` and `min_satin_stroke_width_mm`. Each is an element of
Ink/Stitch's namespace whose text is the value in millimetres, and the first of each name counts. They
become the design's collapse length, shortest stitch and narrowest satin stroke (`REQ-SVG-005`).
`SC-W0802` names a value that is not a number of 0 or more, and the design keeps its default. The
defaults are in the [data model](data-model.md#engine-input-design-stitchcraft-engine).

## Reports

- `SC-W0802` reports a feature that is not stitched. Text, images, clones, nested `<svg>` elements and
  style sheets are such features. So are clipping, masks, filters, markers and the Ink/Stitch settings
  that are not read yet.
- `SC-W0804` reports geometry that cannot be used:
  - path data with an error, stitched up to the error
  - a transform that does not parse, left out with its contents
  - an element that draws nothing
  - a point more than 10 m from the origin
  - a stroke width, join or miter limit that does not read, and a stroke too wide to measure
- `SC-E0801` refuses a file that is not SVG, or that is larger than the adapter reads.

## Text and limits

A file is UTF-8 text, or ISO-8859-1 when its XML declaration says so, which the adapter turns into UTF-8.
A file in any other encoding is refused when it has a byte outside ASCII.

A file is at most 64 MiB with a million XML nodes. Illustrator declares its namespaces as XML entities,
and an entity whose value is plain text is read. A file is refused when an entity's value holds markup or
other entities, or when its references would expand the file past 64 MiB. Without both rules a small
file could need a large amount of memory. Only the document type declaration's internal subset,
`<!DOCTYPE svg [ … ]>`, declares entities: a declaration in a comment or in character data declares
nothing. A name declared twice counts at its longer value. XML keeps the first declaration, and the limit
must hold whichever the parser keeps. Reading charges the budget for each XML node, path segment and
8 bytes of a transform or point list ([budgets](data-model.md#budgets)).
