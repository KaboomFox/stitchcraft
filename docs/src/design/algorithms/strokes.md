# Stroke generators

<!-- implements: crates/stitchcraft-engine/src/generators/mod.rs, crates/stitchcraft-engine/src/generators/running/**, crates/stitchcraft-engine/src/generators/manual.rs, crates/stitchcraft-engine/src/generators/passes.rs, crates/stitchcraft-engine/src/normalize/stroke.rs, crates/stitchcraft-engine/src/normalize/along.rs -->

Strokes follow a path. Shape: `StrokePath` (an ordered list of polylines, corners marked, from the
normalizer). Phase P1 (M3) unless noted.

A stroke starts where it is drawn and ends where it is drawn, as in Ink/Stitch. Its generator is given its
neighbours, as every generator is ([ADR 0014](../adr/0014-generators-see-their-neighbours.md)), and a
stroke sews the same whatever they are. A satin column or a tatami fill before a stroke ends near the
stroke's first point.

## Running stitch

The workhorse: outlines, details, travel, underlay.

**Parameters:** `running_stitch_length_mm` (one length or a repeating pattern of lengths, `LengthList`),
`running_stitch_tolerance_mm`, `repeats`, `bean_stitch_repeats`, `enable_random_stitch_length`,
`random_stitch_length_jitter_percent`, `random_seed`.

### Placement

A stitch is the straight line between two needle points, so placement measures along the path but
checks straight. "The shortest stitch" is the one [Finalize](../engine-pipeline.md#5-finalize) enforces
(settings or profile, whichever is larger).

1. **Flatten.** The normalizer turns the path into polylines within a tenth of the tolerance (the other
   nine tenths are left for the stitches) and marks its corners: joins between segments where the path
   turns by more than 30°. A curve's own bend is never a corner, however tight.
2. **Split at corners.** Every corner gets a needle penetration, so sharp shapes stay sharp, unless it is
   closer than the shortest stitch, along the path, to the previous penetration or to the end: then the
   spans on either side of it are joined.
3. **Even spacing per span.** For a span of length `L` between corners and target length `s`, place
   `n = ceil(L / s − ε)` stitches spaced `L / n` apart along the path. Every stitch is at most `s` and the
   last one is never a short leftover — the classic even-division rule digitizers use. With several
   lengths (`"2.5 1.0"`) the lengths repeat along the path, carrying on from span to span; each span takes
   as many as it needs and scales them by one factor to end exactly on its corner. Lengths below twice
   the shortest stitch are raised to it (`SC-W0402`), so a span longer than the longest length scales its
   stitches by more than a half and keeps each at or above the shortest stitch; in a shorter span, a
   stitch scaled below it joins its shorter neighbour. Where those stitches stray from the path by more
   than the tolerance left after flattening, as on a curve too tight for them, the span is spread again
   in one stitch more, then one more, as long as that takes no more stitches than step 5 would make of
   it, until they keep to it. A small circle is so sewn in even stitches as long as the tolerance allows,
   where splitting the stray ones would halve them. With random length, each try draws its lengths again
   from where the span's draws began.
4. **Measure straight.** Where the path bends back on itself within less than the shortest stitch (a
   cusp, a tight loop, a curl at an end), two points far apart along it can be close in a straight line.
   Going along the needle points: one closer than the shortest stitch to the last one kept is dropped; a
   corner drops the points kept since the previous corner instead, and is dropped itself if that is not
   enough; the end drops whatever it takes, corners too. A drop lengthens the stitch over it, and one
   longer than the longest length is split where the path is half its length from its start (at most
   the longest length), as often as needed. When only the start is left and the end is too close to it
   (a small closed loop), the stitch goes by way of the point of the path farthest from both ends; if
   even that is closer than the shortest stitch, the part is not stitched (`SC-W0401`).
5. **Respect the curve.** If the chord between two consecutive needle points strays from the path by
   more than the tolerance left after flattening, split that stitch at the path's point of greatest
   deviation, among those at least the shortest stitch from both its ends, and repeat. A part longer than
   the longest length is split along the path as in step 4. So the stitches stray from the path by at
   most `running_stitch_tolerance_mm`, except where the path's details are smaller than the shortest
   stitch. There a point of the flattened path that is passed over lies nearer than the shortest stitch
   to a needle of its stitch, and the path strays by less than the shortest stitch plus a tenth of the
   tolerance.
6. **Random length.** With `enable_random_stitch_length`, each stitch length is drawn uniformly from
   `s × (1 ± jitter)`, the first of each span a random fraction of that (a random phase, below), then the
   span is rescaled to end on its corner. The element's own generator draws them. It is seeded with the
   element's `random_seed` (a setting every stitch type that varies at random shares), or with its id
   when that is empty. A seed replaces the id, as in Ink/Stitch, so elements alike given one seed sew
   alike, and the same element and seed always give the same stitches.

**When the rules disagree,** the shortest stitch wins (a shorter stitch hammers one spot and can break the
thread), then corners, then the tolerance. A part of the path that is a single point, shorter than the
shortest stitch, or lying all within it of its ends, is not stitched (`SC-W0401`). Only arithmetic and square roots are used, so
every platform places the same stitches.

**Compared with Ink/Stitch:** the same parameters, meanings and defaults; the placement differs in four
documented ways, `DEV-RUN-001` to `DEV-RUN-004` in the deviations ledger (`conformance/deviations.toml`),
and the random lengths come from another generator (`DEV-RUN-005`).

**Satin underlays** walk lines made point by point by the satin generator
([satin](satin.md#underlays)), and steps 2 to 5 place their stitches, with each walk's own length and
tolerance. Such a line is a polyline already, and each join that turns by more than 30° is a corner. A
line too small for a stitch of the shortest length is sewn as its 2 ends, as Ink/Stitch sews it, and
finalizing merges what is too short.

### Repeats and bean stitch

- `repeats = k` sews the path k times, alternating direction; odd k ends at the far end, even k returns
  to the start (useful for travel that must come back). Each pass starts where the last one ended, so a
  turnaround is not a stitch in place.
- `bean_stitch_repeats = b` replaces every stitch A→B with A→B→A→B… (2b+1 passes), producing the thick
  "triple stitch" line at b = 1. A list (`"1 0"`) alternates bean and plain stitches.
- **Order, as in Ink/Stitch** (read at `d59c9ab`): bean stitch applies after repeats, to every stitch of
  every pass, with the list running on from pass to pass. Ink/Stitch repeats the turnaround point, so
  the turnaround takes one step of the list; StitchCraft counts that step too, without sewing it, so a
  file sews the same in both. With a two-value list, each stretch of the path then gets the same
  treatment on every pass.
- Repeats apply to running, ripple and zigzag strokes; bean stitch to those and to manual stitch (the
  [compatibility contract](../inkstitch-compat-contract.md) lists each parameter's stitch types).

### Random length

Ink/Stitch draws each stitch from `s × (1 ± jitter)` and starts each stretch between corners at a random
phase, its first stitch a random fraction of a drawn length, so rows sewn side by side with the same
settings do not line their holes up. It does not rescale, so the last stitch before a corner is whatever
is left. StitchCraft rescales each span to end on its corner (placement, step 6: no short leftover) and
keeps the random phase, for the same reason.

### Properties (conformance)

- Stitches are spread evenly between corners, in more of them where they stray beyond the tolerance, as
  long as that takes no more than splitting. Measured straight, every stitch is at most
  `s × (1 + jitter)` + 1 µm for the longest length `s` and at least the shortest stitch, and a part too
  small for that is reported (`REQ-RUN-001`).
- Deviation from the source path ≤ tolerance, both ways, measured densely (`REQ-RUN-002`).
- Corners are penetration points unless that would make a stitch too short (`REQ-RUN-003`).
- Bean stitch sews each stitch `2b + 1` times, so a run of n stitches with b throughout has exactly
  `n × (2b + 1)`; the list runs on across repeats, each turnaround taking a step (`REQ-RUN-004`).
- Repeats alternate direction with no stitch in place; their parity decides the exit point
  (`REQ-RUN-005`).
- With random length the lengths vary. The same element and seed give the same stitches, and another
  seed gives others. A seed replaces the element's id, and elements given one seed draw the same lengths
  (`REQ-RUN-007`).

### Diagnostics

`SC-W0401` part of the path too small for the shortest stitch (skipped); `SC-W0402` stitch length below
twice the shortest stitch (raised), a stroke's or a satin underlay's, which the message names.

## Manual stitch

Every node of the path is a needle penetration, in order — for hand-placed stitches and imported stitch
files. A curve gives only its end node: its control points are not stitched and it is not flattened.
When the path is closed it comes back to its start, and a node where the needle already is sews no
stitch. Segments longer than `max_stitch_length_mm` (if set, a setting manual stitch shares with satin
columns) are split into the fewest equal parts no longer than it, but never into parts shorter than the
shortest stitch. A value of 0 means "not set", as in Ink/Stitch, and so does one below 0, so every stitch
is then sewn as drawn. Bean stitch applies, and repeats do not. Lock stitches are added only when
`force_lock_stitches` is set, as in Ink/Stitch (read at `d59c9ab`).

Ink/Stitch's bean stitch takes a step of its list for every point it lists, and it lists some where the
needle already is. A node drawn twice is listed twice, and so is the end of each stitch Ink/Stitch
splits. Where a closed path came back to its start already, the start is listed once more. Its stitch
plan leaves out stitches shorter than its shortest stitch only after the bean stitch, and a node left out
for that keeps its step. StitchCraft gives each of these its step, sewing nothing, and a bean list then
falls on the same stitches in both tools.

The shortest stitch holds here too: a node closer than it to the needle point before it is left out, so
the stitch before runs on to the next node, and `SC-W0403` says how many. A part's last node is always
kept, leaving out the one before it instead. Ink/Stitch drops such points later, over the whole plan,
without a word. A part that is a single point, or too small for one stitch, is not stitched (`SC-W0401`).

Properties: needle points are the nodes in order plus only the documented splits (`REQ-RUN-006`); no
stitch is shorter than the shortest stitch (`REQ-RUN-008`).

## Zigzag stroke (P2, M7)

A zigzag of width `stroke-width` (or the satin width parameters) centred on the path, with peak-to-peak
spacing `zigzag_spacing_mm`, optional `zigzag_angle` (slanted zigzag), and
`stroke_pull_compensation_mm`. Implemented as a satin on a centre line with no underlay (shares the satin
sampler), which keeps one code path for "two sides and alternation".

## Ripple stitch (P3, M10)

A series of copies of the stroke, each progressively scaled, offset or interpolated towards a target
point (or between two rails for "satin-guided ripple"), joined into one continuous running stitch.
Parameters: `line_count`, `min_line_dist_mm`, `staggers`, `skip_start`, `skip_end`, `flip_copies`,
`exponent`, `flip_exponent`, `reverse`, `grid_size_mm`, `grid_first`, `scale_axis`, `scale_start`,
`scale_end`, `rotate_ripples`, `join_style`, `satin_guide_pattern_position`, `reverse_rails`,
`swap_satin_rails`, plus running stitch parameters for each line. Design to be completed at M10; the
properties will include "lines never cross the target point" and "each line is within tolerance of its
interpolated curve".
