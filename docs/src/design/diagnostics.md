# Diagnostics

<!-- implements: crates/stitchcraft-core/src/diag.rs, crates/stitchcraft-core/src/text.rs, apps/stitchcraft-cli/src/commands/explain.rs -->

A diagnostic is a problem with the user's design or input, explained in the user's terms, with a
stable code. Diagnostics are values: the engine collects them and keeps planning whatever it can.
Errors in the Rust sense (`Result`) are reserved for failures to do the work at all
([architecture](architecture.md#errors-and-diagnostics)).

```rust,ignore
pub struct Diagnostic {
    pub code: Code,                  // SC-W0702
    pub severity: Severity,          // Error | Warning | Info
    pub element: Option<ElementId>,  // which object
    pub at: Option<Point>,           // where on the canvas (mm)
    pub message: String,             // one sentence, specific: "Design is 162 × 148 mm; …"
    pub fix: Option<Fix>,            // a hint, or a machine-applicable fix
}
```

## Codes

`SC-` + `E` (error: this element, or the design, cannot be stitched), `W` (warning: stitched, but
probably not what you want) or `I` (info) + four digits grouped by area:

| Range | Area |
|---|---|
| 0000–0099 | Input and budgets |
| 0100–0199 | Parameters |
| 0200–0299 | Satin |
| 0300–0399 | Fills |
| 0400–0499 | Strokes (running, bean, manual, zigzag, ripple) |
| 0500–0599 | Plan assembly (ties, travel, trims, colours) |
| 0600–0699 | Formats and threads |
| 0700–0799 | Machine profile (hoop, limits) |
| 0800–0899 | Hosts (SVG, VectorCraft) |

Codes are never reused. A retired code keeps its page with "retired in vX".

## The registry

All codes live in one table in `stitchcraft-core`: the `registry!` block in `src/diag.rs`, which
defines the `Code` enum. Each entry is one line — variant, id, severity, title — and its doc comment is
the long explanation (Markdown: what it means, why it matters for the sew-out, how to fix it), so the
text users read is also the code's rustdoc. Tests reject an entry whose id is malformed or duplicated,
whose letter disagrees with its severity, or whose explanation is missing. From that table:

- `cargo xtask docs` generates the **diagnostics index** (one page per code, like `rustc`'s error index);
- `stitch explain SC-W0702` prints the explanation in the terminal;
- the VectorCraft plug-in links each message to its page;
- `cargo xtask conformance` fails when a code has no `diag_sc_<code>_<what>` test that produces it from
  real input and checks the text a user reads, or when such a test names a code that is not registered
  ([conformance](conformance.md#cases)); the registry's own tests fail when a code has no explanation.

That last rule is what keeps error paths alive: a message that no test ever renders can ship with a
typo in its formatting and nobody sees it until a user does.

## Writing good messages

- Say what is wrong *and* by how much: "Rows are 0.25 mm apart but the region is only 0.18 mm tall."
- Name the object and point at the place.
- Offer the fix in embroidery terms: "Use a running stitch for parts this thin, or widen the shape."
- No blame, no internal names (`LineString`, `GEOS`), no stack traces.

## Fixes

`Fix::Hint(String)` is advice. `Fix::Apply(Edit)` is a change the host can apply with one click and
undo (for example "rotate the design 90°" for `SC-W0702` when the rotated bounds fit, or "drop the
dangling rung" for `SC-W0203`). Applied fixes go through the host's command system so they are undoable.

## Initial codes

Codes referenced by the design docs; each is registered in the milestone that implements it. A
registered code must keep its row here, with the same severity and a title that starts with the
registry's (`cargo xtask docs --check`), so a code allocated for one thing cannot be registered for
another.

| Code | Severity | Title | Milestone |

| `SC-E0004` | Error | Budget exhausted (work for one element, or stitches for the design) | M1 |

| `SC-W0202` | Warning | Satin rails taken as the two longest subpaths (where the subpaths meet does not say) | M4 |
| `SC-W0203` | Warning | Satin rung does not cross both rails (dangling rung); the rail's nearest point is used | M4 |
| `SC-W0205` | Warning | Satin subpath is one point; left out | M4 |

| `SC-W0210` | Warning | Satin rails without rungs have different numbers of nodes (some pair with none) | M4 |

| `SC-W0311` | Warning | Spiral could not be connected in a narrow part; that part uses inner-to-outer contours | M7 |
| `SC-W0401` | Warning | Path too small for the shortest stitch; skipped | M3 |
| `SC-W0402` | Warning | Stitch length below twice the shortest stitch; raised to it, so even spacing never sews a stitch shorter than the shortest | M3 |
| `SC-W0403` | Warning | Hand-placed stitch shorter than the shortest stitch; point left out | M3 |
| `SC-W0501` | Warning | Travel could not stay inside the region; used tie-off, trim and tie-in | M5 |

| `SC-E0603` | Error | Machine file could not be read (wrong format, truncated, or a record that makes no sense) | M2 |
| `SC-W0604` | Warning | Thread colours unknown (the file stores none, as DST never does; threads are placeholders) | M2 |

| `SC-E0701` | Error | Design does not fit the hoop | M1 |

| `SC-W0804` | Warning | Element geometry invalid or out of range (path data error, invalid transform, draws nothing, beyond 10 m, a stroke's width, join or miter limit that does not read); the usable part is stitched | M3 |
