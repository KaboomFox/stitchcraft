# Architecture decision records

Short records of decisions that shape the code, with their context and the alternatives we rejected.
New ADRs are numbered sequentially and never renumbered; a decision that changes gets a new ADR that
supersedes the old one.

`cargo xtask docs --check` fails if an ADR file is missing from this table or its status here differs
from the file's status line.
