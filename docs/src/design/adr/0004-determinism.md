# ADR-0004: Determinism by construction

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-10-08

## Context

Golden-file conformance, reproducible bug reports, safe caching and CI-regenerated docs images all
require identical output across platforms and runs.

## Decision

Ordered collections only; transcendental math through `libm`; a specified PRNG (SplitMix64) with seeds
from element ids and `random_seed`; quantization of absolute positions once at encode time; total-order
sorts with tie-breakers; budgets in work units, not time; golden files compared byte for byte on Linux,
macOS and Windows. Enforced by clippy `disallowed-types`/`disallowed-methods`. Details:
[determinism](../determinism.md).

## Consequences

- Slightly more verbose code (`BTreeMap`, `math::sin`); negligible performance cost.
- Byte-exact goldens are possible for formats and stitch renders.

## Alternatives considered

- **Tolerance-only comparisons everywhere:** hides real regressions and makes images flaky. Rejected
  except for VectorCraft UI screenshots, which we do not control.

## Amendment, 2026-10-14

The decision first named a CI job that would compare output hashes across Linux, macOS, Windows and
wasm. CI compares each operating system's outputs with the golden files instead, and builds the
WebAssembly target without running it ([cross-platform check](../determinism.md#cross-platform-check)).
