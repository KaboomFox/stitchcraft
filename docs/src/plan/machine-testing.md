# Machine testing protocol

<!-- implements: crates/stitchcraft-engine/src/testsheets/**, apps/stitchcraft-cli/src/commands/testsheet.rs -->

Automated tests prove the files are what we intend. Only a machine proves they sew well. This page is
the protocol for **machine checkpoints** (MC-1 … MC-7) on the reference machine: a Brother PE800, whose
5 × 7 in hoop sews at most 130 × 180 mm. Its 4 × 4 in and small hoops have profiles too, and the TS-10
sheets test them ([ADR 0013](../design/adr/0013-brother-pe800-reference-machine.md)).

## Roles

- **StitchCraft generates** each test sheet deterministically: `stitch testsheet TS-xx -o TS-xx.pes`
  checks it against the profile of the hoop it is for. It prints that profile, the file's SHA-256, its
  size and counts, the threads in the order they are sewn (with the Brother palette name the machine
  shows for each) and what to check after sewing. From M2.7 it
  also writes a picture of the expected result; until then, previews are drawn by the conformance tooling.
  `stitch testsheet --list` lists the sheets. The MC-1 sheets are drawn stitch by stitch, to test the
  machine and the file formats; from MC-2, sheets are drawn as designs and planned by the engine, so
  sewing them tests its stitches, locks and plan assembly too.
- **The tester sews** it with the standard setup below, photographs it, measures it, and files a
  **Sew-out report** issue (the form asks for everything on this page).
- **A maintainer turns the report into changes**: profile values, parameter defaults, new conformance
  cases, or bugs. Every profile change links its report.

## Standard setup (keep it constant)

Record anything that differs in the report.

| Item | Standard |
|---|---|
| Fabric | Medium-weight woven cotton (quilting cotton or twill), pressed |
| Stabilizer | One layer of medium tear-away; cut-away for knits (TS-09 only) |
| Needle | 75/11 embroidery needle, fresh at each checkpoint |
| Top thread | 40 wt polyester embroidery thread; colours as listed on the expected-result sheet (any brand) |
| Bobbin | 60 wt (90 wt) bobbin thread, white |
| Hoop | The 5 × 7 in hoop, unless the sheet names another; fabric drum-tight, design centred |
| Machine settings | Note the machine's speed and its own trim/jump settings (some Brother models trim automatically on long jumps) |

## Photographing and measuring

- **Front and back**, flat, in daylight or a daylight lamp, camera straight above.
- **A ruler in every photo**, along the top and left edges, millimetre side visible.
- **Close-ups** of anything odd (loops, gaps, puckers, bird's nests), with the ruler.
- Measure with a steel ruler or calipers; report in mm with one decimal.
- Rate each item 1–5 (5 = indistinguishable from expected) and add a sentence.

## Test sheets

| Sheet | What it checks | Measure / observe | First used |
|---|---|---|---|
| **TS-01** Orientation & scale | An asymmetric "F", a 100 mm cross with 10 mm ticks, 10 mm squares in the corners (120 × 120 mm) | F not mirrored or rotated; 100 mm line = 100.0 ± 0.5 mm in X and Y; squares square | MC-1 |
| **TS-02** Commands | 3 colour blocks, a stop, and rows of 2 dashes separated by jumps of 2, 5, 15 and 30 mm. Trims are encoded as trim-flagged jumps on the left half (red), and the right half (blue) has plain jumps only (120 × 70 mm) | The machine stops for colours and the stop; which jumps were trimmed on each half; any loose loops | MC-1, MC-2 |
| **TS-02B** Commands, from elements | TS-02 drawn as a design and planned by the engine. Each red dash but the last sets a trim after it (`trim_after`). The blue ones set none, and the 2 mm gap between them is sewn across, because it is within the 3 mm collapse length. The green line stops halfway (`stop_after`). The stitching has a lock wherever it starts or ends (120 × 70 mm) | The same as TS-02, and whether the thread of each dash pulls out where it was cut | MC-2 |
| **TS-03** Running stitch | Lines at 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 and 4.0 mm stitch length, bean 1× and 2×, circles at tolerances of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 mm, and 20 stitches placed by hand at 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7 and 1.0 mm (60 × 78 mm) | Even stitches, smooth curves, solid bean lines, and the shortest hand-placed stitch that sews cleanly | MC-2 |
| **TS-04** Lock stitches | Lines about 30 mm long with every lock shape but custom at both ends, trimmed after: the half stitch on first stitches of 1.5, 2.5 and 4 mm, back-and-forth at 0.5, 0.7 and 1.0 mm, drawn shapes at 70, 100 and 150 % (110 × 65 mm) | Pull each tail gently: does the lock stay, or does the thread pull out? Is the lock visible from the front? | MC-2 |
| **TS-05** Satin width ladder | 3 rows at zigzag spacings of 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 mm, each of 10 columns 20 mm tall and 1 to 10 mm wide, with no underlay (91 × 76 mm). Each column is sewn as drawn, from its top, and trimmed after | Coverage, fabric showing between stitches, edges straight, long stitches loose, how much narrower than drawn | MC-3 |
| **TS-06** Satin underlays | The same column, 6 mm wide and 30 mm tall, with no underlay, a centre walk, a contour, a zigzag, and a contour with a zigzag (62 × 30 mm). Each column is sewn as drawn, from its top, and trimmed after | Edge sharpness, loft, puckering, underlay showing | MC-3 |
| **TS-07** Registration | A 60 mm tatami circle with a running-stitch outline; at three pull-compensation values | Gap or overlap between fill and outline at 12 points around the circle | MC-4 |
| **TS-08** Fill density & angle | 30 mm squares at spacing 0.25–0.6 mm and angles 0°, 45°, 90° | Coverage, stiffness, puckering, visible furrows | MC-4 |
| **TS-09** Fill underlay & travel | A shape with holes and a separated part; with and without underlay | Travel hidden? Trims between parts? Holes clean? | MC-4 |
| **TS-10A/B/C** Hoop size | Frames of 100 × 100 mm (A, the 4 × 4 in hoop), 130 × 180 mm (B, the 5 × 7 in) and 20 × 60 mm (C, the small hoop), each as large as its hoop's field, with a centre cross and an "F" in the top-left corner | The machine takes each design in its hoop without asking for a larger one, and sews it to size. The small hoop's field is the right way round | MC-1, MC-5 |
| **TS-11** New stitch types | Samples of the milestone's new types | Per type, as listed on its expected-result sheet | MC-6 |
| **TS-12** Real design | A design up to 130 × 180 mm authored in VectorCraft with fill, satin, running stitch and 3 colours | Overall quality, registration between colours, and time against the estimate. Satin columns start and end at their nearest points: is the way the needle takes under them hidden? Satin columns drawn as one path: are they as wide as their strokes, and do their corners sew clean? | MC-5, MC-7 |

## Checkpoint calendar

| Checkpoint | After | Sheets | Questions it must answer |
|---|---|---|---|
| MC-1 | M1 | TS-01, TS-02, TS-10A/B/C | Does the machine read our PES? Right size and orientation? Which trim encoding works? Does each hoop take a design as large as its profile allows, from PES v1? |
| MC-2 | M3 | TS-03, TS-04, TS-02B | Minimum stitch length and lock defaults? Does the machine trim where an element asks? |
| MC-3 | M4 | TS-05, TS-06 | Satin spacing, width limits, underlay defaults, pull compensation |
| MC-4 | M5 | TS-07, TS-08, TS-09 | Fill spacing, compensation, underlay and travel defaults |
| MC-5 | M6 | TS-12, TS-10 | Is the VectorCraft workflow complete and correct? |
| MC-6 | M7 | TS-11 | New stitch types acceptable? |
| MC-7 | M12 | all | Release regression |

## Report template

The GitHub issue form *Sew-out report* asks for these fields; this is the same template for notes kept
elsewhere:

## From report to change

1. A maintainer reads the report and labels it `sewout:pass`, `sewout:tune` or `sewout:bug`.
2. **Tune:** the profile or default changes in a PR that links the report; a conformance case pins the
   new value; the docs' parameter pages show the evidence link.
3. **Bug:** a failing conformance case reproducing it comes first, then the fix.
4. **Pass:** the checkpoint row in `ROADMAP.md` is ticked with the report link.
