# Check a machine file before sewing

StitchCraft reads PES, PEC and DST files from any software. It can describe a file and draw what the
machine will sew, before you spend thread on it. The examples use test sheet TS-02, written with
`stitch testsheet TS-02 -o TS-02.pes`.

## Describe the file

```console
{{#include ../reference/generated/inspect-ts-02.txt}}
```

- **size** is the width and height of the stitching.
- **stitches** counts the needle points, and the jumps, trims, colour changes and stops between them.
- **extent** gives the lowest and highest x and y of the stitching, from where the machine starts.
- **lengths** gives the shortest and the longest stitch, to a hundredth of a millimetre, and how many
  stitches do not move at all, when a file has any.
- **threads** lists the colour blocks in sewing order. Each colour is stored as a Brother palette colour
  in a PES file, which the line names. After a stop you sew on with the same thread.
- **profile** appears with `--profile`, with the number of stitches longer than the machine's longest
  stitch and shorter than its shortest. `stitch profiles` lists the machines. A file does not say which
  stitches lock the thread, and StitchCraft's lock stitches are as short as 0.2 mm on purpose. The line
  also counts the short stitches 0.2 mm or longer, which may be locks.

## Look at it

```console
{{#include ../reference/generated/preview-ts-02.txt}}
```

The simple style draws each stitch as a thin line with a dot at each needle point. A red cross marks a
trim and a blue square a stop. Grey dashes show where the frame travels after a cut, and dashes in the
thread's colour show a jump thread left on the fabric.

Without `--style simple`, the picture shows the finished embroidery, with loose jump threads where they
will be. The [rendering design](../../design/rendering.md#styles) has the whole legend.

## What to look for

- A design larger than the hoop, or than the machine's comfort zone: see [fit the hoop](fit-the-hoop.md).
- Jump threads where you expected trims. Each one has to be cut by hand after sewing.
- Thread colours. The machine shows each block in its palette colour, and it sews whichever thread you
  load.
