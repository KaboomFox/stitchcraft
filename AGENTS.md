# StitchCraft — instructions for contributors and agents

StitchCraft is an independent, MIT OR Apache-2.0 machine-embroidery engine in Rust, with plug-ins for
[VectorCraft](https://github.com/storytold/vectorcraft). This file is the contract for everyone who
changes the code — people and AI agents alike. `CLAUDE.md` points here; there is only one copy.

## Start every session here

1. Read `ROADMAP.md` (status) and pick the next step from `docs/src/plan/roadmap.md`, unless you were
   given a task.
2. Read the design pages that step touches, starting from `docs/src/design/README.md`. The technical
   design (`docs/src/design/tdd.md`) is the overview. `cargo xtask docs for PATH` names the pages that
   describe a file. In Claude Code, a hook in `.claude/settings.json` names them after each edit.
3. Work conformance-first: add requirements and failing cases, then the code that makes them pass, then
   the docs. A Rust test named `req_<area>_<nnn>_<what>` is a case for `REQ-<AREA>-<NNN>`, and one named
   `diag_sc_<e|w|i><nnnn>_<what>` is the case that produces diagnostic `SC-<E|W|I><NNNN>`. Finish with
   `cargo xtask ci`.

## Non-negotiables

- **Never copy GPL code.** Ink/Stitch's source (GPL-3.0), like any GPL/AGPL code, may be read to
  understand its behaviour, but nothing from it is copied, pasted, transliterated or closely paraphrased:
  behaviour goes into our design docs in our own words, and code is written from them. Ink/Stitch's
  parameter *names*, defaults and method ids are the interoperability contract and are used as-is
  (`docs/src/design/adr/0012-read-dont-copy.md`).
- **Never crash.** No `unwrap`, `expect`, `panic!`, `unreachable!`, `todo!`, `unimplemented!` or
  `dbg!` outside tests; no unchecked indexing on data; return `Result` or a coded diagnostic. Every loop
  over input charges a `Budget`. Tests may unwrap.
- **No `unsafe`,** except the VectorCraft ABI shim `apps/stitchcraft-vc-plugin/src/abi.rs`, where every
  block has a `// SAFETY:` comment (`cargo xtask unsafe-audit`).
- **Deterministic.** No `HashMap`/`HashSet`, platform transcendental math, OS randomness or clocks in
  library crates; use `stitchcraft_core::{math, rng}` and ordered collections.
- **Layered.** A crate depends only on lower layers (`cargo xtask layers`; table in `xtask/src/layers.rs`).
- **Movable into VectorCraft.** VectorCraft's maintainers can take this repository in as a folder
  (`docs/src/design/adr/0011-movable-into-vectorcraft.md`). Every package is named `stitchcraft-*`; crates
  inherit only `version`, `edition`, `license`, `rust-version`, `repository` and lints from the workspace;
  tooling finds files from its own folder and runs Cargo on StitchCraft's packages (`util::packages`),
  never with `--workspace`. The `move` job in `compat.yml` checks it.
- **One source of truth (DRY).** Parameters, diagnostics, profiles and formats live in their registries;
  docs, UI schemas, CLI help and test strategies are generated from them. Never hand-write a parameter's
  docs or duplicate a constant — import it.
- **Verify bugs before fixing them.** Reproduce with a failing test or conformance case first; a fix
  without a reproducing case is not done. When citing a bug in another project, cite evidence you
  checked (issue page, commit, code you ran or read).
- **No silent fallbacks.** A degraded result always emits a coded diagnostic.
- **Docs extend context.** Every crate has a `README.md` stating its purpose, invariants and
  dependencies; every module starts with `//!` docs explaining *why*. Update docs in the same PR as the
  behaviour. Write them plainly, as `docs/src/contributing/writing-style.md` says: `cargo xtask prose`
  checks the lines a branch adds.
- **One roadmap step per PR,** titled with its id (`M3.4: running stitch even spacing`).

## Commands

```sh
cargo xtask ci                     # every gate: fmt, clippy, tests, rustdoc, layers, filesize,
                                   # cleanroom, unsafe-audit, docs --check, shots --check, conformance
                                   # (the whole suite, with its report), wasm, api --check, deny, typos,
                                   # prose, book
cargo xtask layers                 # crate dependency rules
cargo xtask docs --check           # docs fresh, links, anchors, ids and paths valid, no fact on two pages
cargo xtask prose                  # Vale on the Markdown lines this branch adds (writing style)
cargo xtask docs                   # regenerate generated docs pages
cargo xtask shots --check          # docs images declared, reproducible and current
cargo xtask conformance            # run the suite; report in target/conformance/report.md
cargo xtask conformance --check    # requirements and cases consistent (no run)
cargo xtask conformance --bless ID # rewrite one data case's golden files, on purpose
cargo xtask cleanroom              # no GPL licence text or pasted Python source anywhere, docs included
cargo xtask compat join [--nested] DIR  # make this folder, copied into a VectorCraft checkout, part of its build
cargo xtask unsafe-audit           # unsafe only in the ABI shim, always with SAFETY comments
cargo xtask filesize               # warn above 800 lines, fail above 1,500
cargo xtask wasm                   # library crates build for wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo xtask wasm --goldens         # stitch, built for WASI and run by wasmtime, makes the golden files
cargo xtask api                    # rewrite the public API snapshots (crates/*/public-api.txt)
cargo xtask coverage               # line coverage per crate against conformance/coverage.toml (CI job)
cargo xtask mutants DIR…           # cargo-mutants results against conformance/mutation.toml (weekly)
cargo xtask mutants --changed DIR  # a pull request's changed-line mutants: noticed, or listed equivalents
```

`cargo xtask ci` skips a step whose tool is not installed locally, and CI installs and requires each of
them. They are the wasm targets, wasmtime, `cargo-public-api`, `cargo-deny`, `typos`, Vale, `mdbook`,
and pyembroidery for the reader oracle (`conformance/oracle/requirements.txt`). CI pins their versions,
the tools' in `.github/actions/tools/action.yml`, wasmtime's in `ci.yml` and Vale's in `xtask/src/prose.rs`. Coverage
(`cargo-llvm-cov`) and mutation testing (`cargo-mutants`) have CI jobs of their own. A change to a
library's public API shows in its `public-api.txt`: say why in the pull request.

## Where code goes

See "Where does my code go?" in `docs/src/design/architecture.md`, and the playbooks in
`docs/src/contributing/` for new stitch types, parameters, formats and diagnostics.

## VectorCraft

The plug-in targets VectorCraft's WebAssembly ABI v1 (`docs/src/design/vectorcraft-integration.md`).
Do not depend on VectorCraft internals beyond that ABI, its documented `.vectorcraft` format, and the
documented commands of its command line that `stitch plan` traces a picture with (ADR-0015); the
compatibility gate (`docs/src/design/compatibility-gate.md`) tests every VectorCraft release, pre-release,
`release` branch and `main`. Proposed VectorCraft changes go through the plug-in features RFC, following
VectorCraft's own `AGENTS.md`.

## Machine testing

Changes that affect what sews are listed for the next machine checkpoint
(`docs/src/plan/machine-testing.md`). Profile values change only with a sew-out report that justifies them.
