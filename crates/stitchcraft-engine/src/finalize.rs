//! Pipeline stages 5 and 6 (finalize and check): the assembled plan fitted to the machine, then checked.
//!
//! Design: `docs/src/design/engine-pipeline.md` › Finalize and › Check. Generators already keep their own
//! stitches within the machine's limits; what is left for here comes from joining things up and from
//! settings the machine cannot follow:
//!
//! 1. **The shortest stitch.** Where one element's stitching runs straight on into the next, the stitch
//!    between them can be anything up to the collapse length, 0 included. A needle point less than its
//!    element's shortest stitch from the one before is left out, so the stitch runs on to the next. That
//!    is the shortest stitch the element's generator used (its own, else the design's, never below the
//!    machine's), so finalize never thins what the generator spaced. The first and last points of a run
//!    of stitches (where the needle lands, and where a jump, trim or stop follows) and lock points always
//!    stay, and leave out the ones before them instead; a point where the needle already is adds nothing
//!    and is left out too. A stitch into or out of a lock point is a lock stitch, whose shortest is
//!    0.2 mm. `SC-I0504` says how many were left out. The rule is one function, `thin`, which the
//!    generators that join pieces of their own share, so that they leave finalize nothing to thin.
//! 2. **The longest stitch.** A stitch longer than the machine's is split into equal parts: a hand-placed
//!    stitch, say, or a custom lock's long step (`SC-I0703`). Each part counts against the stitch budget.
//! 3. **The machine.** Too many colour changes and stops for the machine's format is `SC-E0601`. A design
//!    larger than the hoop, reaching past its edge from an origin far from the design's middle, or with a
//!    stop position past the edge is `SC-E0701`, whatever else is true of it. Otherwise a design larger
//!    than the comfort zone is `SC-W0702`.
//! 4. **The check.** The plan invariants (`stitchcraft_plan::invariants`) must hold; a broken one is a bug
//!    in StitchCraft (`SC-E0009`), and nothing is written.
