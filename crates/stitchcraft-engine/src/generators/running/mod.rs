//! Running stitch: single stitches along a path, for outlines, details, travel and underlay.
//!
//! Design: `docs/src/design/algorithms/strokes.md` › Running stitch. A stroke is stitched in five steps:
//!
//! 1. **Flatten** the path ([`crate::normalize::stroke`]) to within a tenth of the curve tolerance, and
//!    mark its corners. The other nine tenths are left for the stitches.
//! 2. **Cut at the corners.** Every corner gets a needle penetration, so sharp shapes stay sharp. The
//!    exception is a corner closer than the shortest stitch to the previous penetration or to the end,
//!    measured along the path: the spans on either side of it are joined.
//! 3. **Spread the stitches evenly.** Each span gets as many stitches of the pattern as it takes to
//!    reach its length, all shortened by one factor so that the last one ends exactly on the corner: no
//!    stitch is longer than its pattern length, and none is a short leftover. Pattern lengths are raised
//!    to at least twice the shortest stitch (`SC-W0402`). A span longer than the longest pattern length
//!    then shortens its stitches by less than half, which keeps every one at or above the shortest
//!    stitch; in a shorter span, a stitch shortened below it joins its shorter neighbour, and the joined
//!    stitch is no longer than the span. With random length, each stitch is drawn from its length
//!    ± the jitter and each span starts at a random phase, then the same scaling applies. Where the
//!    stitches stray from the path by more than nine tenths of the tolerance, as on a curve too tight for
//!    them, the span is spread again in one stitch more, and one more, as long as that takes no more
//!    stitches than step 5 would make of it, until they keep to it: a small circle is sewn in even stitches
//!    as long as the tolerance allows, where splitting would halve them. With random length the draws are
//!    made again from where the span's started.
//! 4. **Measure straight.** Steps 2 and 3 measure along the path, but a stitch is the straight line
//!    between two needle points, and where the path bends back on itself within less than the shortest
//!    stitch (a cusp, a tight loop) two points far apart along it can be close together. So the needle
//!    points that would make a stitch shorter than the shortest stitch are dropped, and points are added
//!    along the path where a drop would make one longer than the longest pattern length.
//! 5. **Follow the curve.** A stitch whose straight line strays from the path by more than the remaining
//!    nine tenths of the tolerance is split at the point of the path farthest from it, as often as needed,
//!    and a part longer than the longest pattern length is split along the path as in step 4. A point
//!    closer than the shortest stitch to an end of the stitch is passed over: it strays from the stitch by
//!    less than that.
//!
//! Each run is then sewn its repeats and bean stitch ([`crate::generators::passes`]).
//!
//! When the rules disagree, the shortest stitch wins (a shorter stitch hammers one spot and can break
//! the thread), then corners, then the tolerance. A piece of the path that is a single point, shorter
//! than the shortest stitch, or all within it of its ends, is not stitched (`SC-W0401`). Only arithmetic and square
//! roots are used: every platform places the same stitches.
//!
//! A satin column's underlays walk lines the satin generator builds point by point, and `along_line`
//! sews them with the same steps 2 to 5, as Ink/Stitch sews its underlays with its running stitch.
