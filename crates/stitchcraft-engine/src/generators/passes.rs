//! Passes over a run of stitches: repeats and bean stitch, for a bolder line or a line that comes back.
//!
//! Design: `docs/src/design/algorithms/strokes.md` › Repeats and bean stitch. A run is the needle points
//! of one pass along a piece of a stroke; the generators that sew lines (running stitch now, manual stitch
//! in M3.6) hand theirs to [`sew`]:
//!
//! - **Repeats** sew the run k times, every other pass backwards. Each pass starts where the last one
//!   ended, so a turnaround is never a stitch in place.
//! - **Bean stitch** then sews each stitch from A to B 2b + 1 times: A to B, then b times back to A and on
//!   to B. b is taken in turn from a list, which runs on from pass to pass. Every point of a pass takes a
//!   step of it, and a point where the needle already is sews nothing: each pass after the first starts
//!   with the point the last ended at, and manual stitch lists some points again. That is Ink/Stitch's
//!   counting (it lists the turnaround point again, and the repeated point takes a step), so a file sews
//!   the same in both tools; with a two-value list it also sews each stretch of the line the same way on
//!   every pass.
