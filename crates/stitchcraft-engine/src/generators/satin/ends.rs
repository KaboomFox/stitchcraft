//! Where a satin column starts and ends (`docs/src/design/algorithms/satin.md` › Start and end): near
//! where the elements before it left the needle (`start_at_nearest_point`), and near where the next
//! element starts (`end_at_nearest_point`), as Ink/Stitch does by default.
//!
//! - **The line** between the rails at `running_stitch_position`, a running stitch of the travel length
//!   within `running_stitch_tolerance_mm`, is the needle's way to the start and between the passes.
//! - **Cuts.** A place is found by its cut: of the pairs at the zigzag spacing, with no compensation and
//!   nothing random, the one with the point nearest it. The line is entered where it comes nearest the
//!   cut, and a part is cut in 2 at its own point nearest it.
//! - **The start** is the line's point nearest the needle, or the compensated outline's when only that is
//!   within the jump length. The needle follows the line from the start's cut to the first stitch's.
//! - **The end** is the compensated outline's point nearest the next stitch, found on the rails as
//!   Ink/Stitch finds it (the `generators::next` module): before a fill, the first rail start that lies in
//!   it. It changes nothing within 5 CSS pixels of the line's end. Every part is cut in 2 at the end's cut:
//!   the first halves are sewn, the line is followed to its end (or, after an odd centre walk, to where the
//!   second pass starts), the second halves are sewn, and the end is stitched last.
//!
//! The pieces are joined as the underlays are, in straight stitches no longer than the travel, which the
//! column raises to twice the shortest stitch, as it does for the line. A point of the line's way within
//! the shortest stitch of the needle, or of the way's point before it, only routes the needle, and is left
//! out: finalize would leave it out too, with a note about a point the design never drew. An end within the
//! shortest stitch of the needle moves the needle's last point there instead of adding a stitch too short
//! to sew, so the column's last stitch, often a top stitch, is never split.
