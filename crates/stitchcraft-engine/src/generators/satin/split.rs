//! Split stitches, and the order the needle sews a satin column's points in
//! (`docs/src/design/algorithms/satin.md` › Top stitches, steps 4 and 5, › E-stitch and › S-stitch).
//!
//! A satin column's needle goes from the first rail to the second and back, pair after pair: each stitch
//! across the column, from a pair's first point to its second, and each stitch back, from its second point
//! to the next pair's first. An E-stitch's goes across and back at each pair, a spike, and along the first
//! rail from one spike to the next, its spine. An S-stitch's goes across once at each pair, every other one
//! from the second rail, and along a rail from one pair to the next. Where the element sets a longest stitch
//! (`max_stitch_length_mm`), a stitch longer than it is split as `split_method` says, as Ink/Stitch splits
//! it. The ends of a stitch are its pair's compensated points, and it is sewn between their insets
//! (step 3).
//!
//! - **Default** splits a stitch into the fewest equal parts no longer than the longest stitch, and the
//!   stitch back after it into as many as the stitch across before it. `random_split_jitter_percent` moves
//!   each split up to that share of a part either way, at random. With `random_split_phase`, the splits
//!   start a random share of the longest stitch from the stitch's inset start instead, and follow at the
//!   longest stitch, longer or shorter by up to the jitter. Stitches no longer than
//!   `min_random_split_length_mm` are not split, and a split within the shortest stitch of an end is left
//!   out, unless it is the only one.
//! - **Simple** splits a stitch at whole multiples of the longest stitch from its start, and the stitch
//!   back from its end, where they lie between its insets.
//! - **Staggered** does the same from a start that moves along by a `split_staggers`-th of the longest
//!   stitch from one stitch to the next, and comes back after that many stitches.
//!
//! An E-stitch's spike goes back down through the splits of its stitch across. Its spine is split only when
//! the zigzag spacing is longer than the longest stitch, with no randomness, as Ink/Stitch splits it. An
//! S-stitch's stitch across splits as a stitch from the first rail to the second, whichever way it is sewn,
//! and its steps along the rails are never split: Ink/Stitch works out splits for them but sews none.
//!
//! Random splits draw from the element's generator, after the column's pairs are placed, in the order the
//! stitches are sewn.
