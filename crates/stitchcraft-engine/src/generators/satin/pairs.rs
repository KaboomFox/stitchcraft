//! A satin column's needle points, placed along its sections as Ink/Stitch places them
//! (`docs/src/design/algorithms/satin.md` › Top stitches).
//!
//! The stitches go across the column in pairs of needle points, one on each rail at the same fraction of
//! its section, and the column is sewn first rail, second rail, pair after pair. Each pair is meant to lie
//! the zigzag spacing from the one before it, measured across the column: at a right angle to the previous
//! pair, at whichever end is farther (the outside of a curve), or from the previous pair's first point when
//! that pair has no length.
//!
//! In each section, a pair is placed the spacing's share of the section's longer rail past the one before.
//! A pair that lands more than 5 % off the spacing moves: the step to it is scaled by how far off it is, at
//! most twice, and the first time no farther than the section's end. The first pair of a section after the
//! first is placed as far past the section's start as the previous pair is short of the spacing from it.
//! The column starts with a pair at its start, and ends with one at its end unless the last pair is within
//! 0.1 mm of it.
//!
//! With random spacing, each step's spacing is drawn at random, at each section's start and after each
//! pair, and a pair moves to lie that spacing from the one before. Pairs are measured from each other as
//! the rails place them, and each is widened by pull compensation only as it goes into the column
//! (the `compensation` module).
