//! What makes up for the fabric, and what varies at random (`docs/src/design/algorithms/satin.md` ›
//! Compensation).
//!
//! Thread under tension pulls the fabric in across a satin column, so a column sews narrower than it is
//! drawn, and the stitches push the fabric out at the column's ends. **Pull compensation** moves both ends
//! of every stitch outward along the stitch: by `pull_compensation_mm`, plus `pull_compensation_percent`
//! of the stitch's width, with one value for both sides or one for each. Negative values move them inward,
//! and two ends that would cross meet instead, where their moves divide the stitch. A stitch whose ends are
//! one point has no direction to move them in and stays as it is. A tatami fill lengthens its rows with
//! the same move (`generators::pull`). **Push compensation** takes
//! `push_compensation_mm` off each rail at the column's start and end, before the rails are cut into
//! sections, or adds it along the rail's first or last segment where it is negative. A rail that taking it
//! off would leave shorter than half a CSS pixel keeps its length (`SC-W0211`), as in Ink/Stitch.
//!
//! **Random variation** comes from the element's generator. On each side, a stitch's share of the width
//! is drawn between `pull_compensation_percent` less `random_width_decrease_percent` and plus
//! `random_width_increase_percent`. Each step to the next stitch is drawn between the zigzag spacing less
//! and plus `random_zigzag_spacing_percent` of it, and never below a hundredth of it. As in Ink/Stitch, the
//! spacing is drawn at each section's start and after each stitch, and the widths with each stitch, so
//! turning one kind of variation on leaves the other's draws as they were.
//!
//! **Underlays** place their pairs the same way, moved in by their insets as by negative pull
//! compensation, and draw nothing at random, as in Ink/Stitch. Turning an underlay on leaves the top
//! stitches' draws as they were.
