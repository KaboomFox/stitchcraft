//! Underlays (`docs/src/design/algorithms/satin.md` › Underlays): stitches sewn before a satin column's
//! top stitches, which hold the fabric still and lift the top stitches off it, as Ink/Stitch sews them.
//!
//! Each underlay places pairs of points across the column as the top stitches are placed, along the same
//! sections (the `pairs` module), moved in by its insets as negative pull compensation moves a pair, and
//! with nothing drawn at random (the `compensation` module).
//!
//! - The **centre walk** places pairs every `center_walk_underlay_stitch_tolerance_mm`, each moved in until
//!   its ends meet `center_walk_underlay_position` percent of the way from the first rail to the second. A
//!   running stitch of `center_walk_underlay_stitch_length_mm` follows the line through them, there and
//!   back, `center_walk_underlay_repeats` times. Ink/Stitch uses the satin's running stitch tolerance here
//!   in place of the centre walk's own (`DEV-SAT-004`).
//! - The **contour** places pairs every `contour_underlay_stitch_tolerance_mm`, inset by
//!   `contour_underlay_inset_mm` plus `contour_underlay_inset_percent` of the width, and runs a running
//!   stitch along each rail's side. Each side then stops short of the column's start by the first rail's
//!   inset in millimetres and of its end by the second's, as push compensation shortens a rail: a side too
//!   short for that keeps its length (`SC-W0206`). The first rail's side goes towards the end, and the
//!   second's back.
//! - The **zigzag** places pairs every half `zigzag_underlay_spacing_mm`, inset by its own insets, which are
//!   half the contour's when left empty. It zigzags to the column's end through one end of each pair, the
//!   rails taking turns, and back through the other ends. Each way, a rail's points lie the spacing apart.
//!   A stitch longer than `zigzag_underlay_max_stitch_length_mm` is split into equal parts.
//!
//! A centre walk with an odd number of repeats ends at the column's end, and the contour, the zigzag and
//! the top stitches then run from the end to the start. The needle goes straight from each part to the
//! next, in equal stitches no longer than the running stitch's length.
