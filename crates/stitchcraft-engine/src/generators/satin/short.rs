//! Short stitches on curves (`docs/src/design/algorithms/satin.md` › Top stitches, step 3).
//!
//! On the inside of a tight curve, a rail's needle points crowd together, and the thread piles up where
//! they meet. Ink/Stitch insets some of them, and so does StitchCraft. On each rail, a needle point closer
//! than `short_stitch_distance_mm` to the last point left in place there moves in along its stitch, by a
//! `short_stitch_inset` percentage of the stitch's width. Points that crowd one after another take turns
//! with the percentages and start over at the first, so `15 30` insets them by 15 %, 30 %, 15 % and on. A
//! point at least that far from the last one left in place stays, and is the one the next points are
//! measured from. A distance of 0 insets none.
//!
//! The points are the compensated ones. An inset moves its point toward the other end of the stitch, as
//! negative pull compensation does.
