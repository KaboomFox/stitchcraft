//! TS-02B — TS-02 drawn as a design: colour changes, a stop, jumps, and the trims elements ask for.
//!
//! TS-02's rows of two 10 mm dashes, the dashes 2, 5, 15 and 30 mm apart (top to bottom), but each dash an
//! element and each command one an element asks for, so the engine's plan assembly decides the jumps,
//! trims, locks and stops that TS-02 spells out stitch by stitch (`designed`). Left half (red): every dash
//! but the last says `trim_after`, so the engine sews a tie-off, trims, jumps and sews a tie-in. Right half
//! (blue): no element asks for a trim; the 2 mm gap is within the collapse length (3 mm), so it is sewn
//! across, and the others get a tie-off, a jump and a tie-in. A green line at the bottom stops halfway
//! (`stop_after`). Sewn, it answers: do the locks hold the dashes, where the machine cuts the thread and
//! where the thread of a jump, which it does not cut (MC-1), is snipped?
