//! TS-05 — satin columns 1 to 10 mm wide at 3 zigzag spacings: how dense a satin must be to cover the
//! fabric, how wide it sews well, and how much the thread pulls it in.
//!
//! Drawn as a design (`designed`), so the engine's satin column sews it, with Ink/Stitch's other defaults:
//! no underlay and no pull compensation. 3 rows, top to bottom, at zigzag spacings of 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 mm.
//! Each row has 10 columns 20 mm tall, 1 to 10 mm wide from left to right. Each column is sewn as drawn,
//! not from its nearest point, and trimmed after, so the columns stand apart.
//!
//! The rows are sewn left to right and right to left in turn, and the columns down and up in turn, each from
//! its corner nearest where the one before ended. The reference machine cuts no jump (MC-1): a column sewn
//! down after one sewn down would start along the jump thread from the bottom of the one before, and sew it
//! down under its first stitches.
