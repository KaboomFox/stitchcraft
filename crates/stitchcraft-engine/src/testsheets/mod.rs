//! Test sheets: designs drawn in code for machine checkpoints (`docs/src/plan/machine-testing.md`).
//!
//! Each sheet answers specific questions about a machine — orientation, scale, which trim encoding it
//! obeys, which hoop sizes it accepts, which stitch lengths and locks hold — and lists what to look at
//! after sewing it. Each is for one hoop of the reference machine, its profile: the 5 × 7 in for most, and
//! the others for the TS-10 sheets that test them. The command line writes them (`stitch testsheet TS-01
//! -o TS-01.pes`, checked against the sheet's profile unless `--profile` names another). The tests below
//! check that every sheet is a valid plan for its profile and fits its hoop, so a sheet can never ask a
//! machine to do something StitchCraft's own rules forbid.
//!
//! The MC-1 sheets are drawn stitch by stitch (`sketch`), to test the machine and the file formats; from
//! MC-2 they are drawn as designs and planned by the engine (`designed`), to test its stitches too. The MC-3
//! sheets sew satin columns: a ladder of widths and spacings, and the underlays side by side.
//! Sheets use exact Brother PEC thread colours, so a Brother machine shows the thread names the
//! expected-result sheet lists.
