//! The engine's input: a design, independent of the host it came from.
//!
//! Hosts (the SVG adapter, the VectorCraft adapter) translate their documents into a [`Design`]: elements
//! in stitching order, each with its geometry in millimetres (y down), a thread and its parameters. The
//! engine never sees a host document, so every host gets the same stitches for the same design
//! (`docs/src/design/data-model.md`).
//!
//! Geometry stays exact here: lines and Bézier curves with their control points, already transformed
//! into millimetres. Flattening to stitches is the generators' job, with the tolerance their parameters
//! give, and a fill's region is normalized into polygons with holes ([`crate::normalize::region`]).
