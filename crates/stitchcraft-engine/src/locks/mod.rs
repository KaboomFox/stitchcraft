//! Lock stitches: a few small stitches where an element's stitching starts (the tie-in) and where it ends
//! (the tie-off), so the thread holds when it is trimmed or jumps on.
//!
//! Design: `docs/src/design/algorithms/locks.md`. Plan assembly (roadmap M3.8) decides which ends of which
//! groups get a lock (`ties`, `force_lock_stitches`, jumps and trims); this module sews one lock at one
//! end of a group's needle points:
//!
//! 1. **Where it lies.** The anchor is the point where the stitching starts or ends. Steps are distances
//!    along the stitching from the anchor, positive into it, so a lock of steps follows the stitching round
//!    its corners and the stitching covers it. A drawn lock lies in a frame at the anchor: x along the
//!    stitch there, pointing into the stitching, and y across it.
//! 2. **The shape** ([`LOCKS`]): the half stitch, sized from that stitch; steps, sized by
//!    `lock_*_scale_mm`; a drawn loop, sized by `lock_*_scale_percent`; or the element's custom steps.
//! 3. **No lock stitch shorter than 0.2 mm** ([`LOCK_MIN_STITCH`]), so the needle never goes back into the
//!    hole it just left: a shorter step is lengthened to it, a drawn lock enlarged until its shortest
//!    stitch is that long, and a lock of steps that a sharp turn would fold onto itself sewn straight
//!    along the first (or last) stitch (`SC-W0502`).
//! 4. **The ends.** A lock is sewn in the same order at both ends. A tie-in leads into the anchor: its
//!    steps end there, its loop starts there. A tie-off leaves from it: its steps start there, its loop
//!    comes back to it, where the thread is trimmed. That is how Ink/Stitch reads custom steps, so a file
//!    sews the same in both.
