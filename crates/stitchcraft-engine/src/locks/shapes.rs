//! The lock shapes: StitchCraft's own design behind each of Ink/Stitch's lock ids.
//!
//! The ids are the interoperability contract, so a file that asks for a bowtie gets one; the shapes are
//! designed here, never taken from Ink/Stitch (ADR-0001; deviation `DEV-LCK-001` in
//! `conformance/deviations.toml`). Design: `docs/src/design/algorithms/locks.md`.
//!
//! A shape is drawn in a frame at the end of the stitching it secures: x runs along the stitching, into
//! it, and y across it, in millimetres. Every shape follows the same rules, so each one holds the same
//! way and hides under the stitching it secures:
//!
//! - **A loop from the stitching's end back to it.** The needle arrives at the start of the stitching, sews
//!   the lock and carries on from where it arrived; at the end, it sews the lock and is back where the
//!   stitching ended, for the trim.
//! - **Mostly ahead of that point,** at most 1.4 mm along the stitching and 0.6 mm across it at 100 %,
//!   so the stitching covers the lock.
//! - **Stitches 0.46 to 1.4 mm long at 100 %,** well clear of the 0.2 mm a lock stitch needs, and long
//!   enough to grip.
//!
//! Which size parameter a shape takes follows from its kind: steps take `lock_*_scale_mm`, drawn loops
//! `lock_*_scale_percent`, and a custom lock either. [`LOCKS`], [`SIZED_IN_MM`] and [`SIZED_IN_PERCENT`]
//! are computed from the one table below, so they cannot disagree with it.
