//! Nearest points: of polylines to a point, of 2 segments to each other, of polylines to polylines.
//!
//! Where an element starts and ends depends on where its neighbours are (`docs/src/design/adr/
//! 0014-generators-see-their-neighbours.md`), measured as the nearest points between shapes. Shapes are
//! often equally near at several points: rails side by side, an end on a rail, a side along a cut. Of those
//! the first found is taken, so every platform picks the same, and they are found as the geometry library
//! Ink/Stitch uses finds them, so the same one as there. Each rule below was checked against that library.
//!
//! - **Order.** One shape is measured from, against the other: each of its polylines against each of the
//!   other's in turn, and side by side within them, its own sides outermost. Within 2 sides, the measured
//!   side's points nearest the other's start and end come before its own start and end
//!   ([`between_segments`]).
//! - **Meeting.** Sides that cross meet where they cross, and sides that touch meet at the end that
//!   touches, exactly ([`meeting`]). Whether an end lies on a side is decided in double precision, and the
//!   library decides it exactly: an end within a rounding error of a side can touch it here and not there,
//!   where the library takes the foot of that end instead, a rounding error away.
//! - **Measures.** Points are as far apart as the square root of the sum of the squares says. A point is
//!   as far from a side as from its nearer end when its foot lies beyond one, and otherwise as far as it is
//!   square to the side. Sides are 0 apart where they meet, and otherwise as far as the nearest of their
//!   4 ends is from the other side.
//!
//! Only arithmetic and square roots are used (`docs/src/design/determinism.md`).
