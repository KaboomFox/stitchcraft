//! A satin column drawn as one path, its centre line, made into rails and rungs (`REQ-SAT-016`,
//! `REQ-SAT-017`), as Ink/Stitch makes them when it sews one.
//!
//! The rails are the centre line offset by half the stroke's width to each side, with the stroke's join
//! ([`super::offset`]): the first rail to the right of the line in y-up axes, the second to its left.
//! Rungs cross the column where its line runs straight, away from sharp corners, and at its nodes:
//!
//! - **Scores.** Each corner of the line scores the square of its turn in degrees, in the hundredth of the
//!   line's length where it lies. A blur spreads each score over 4 hundredths to either side, weighted 1,
//!   2, 4, 8, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. A rung goes where the blurred score stops falling or starts rising: just
//!   before and after each sharp corner, where the column can bend its stitches round it.
//! - **Nodes.** A rung goes at each node of the line too, but never at its very start or end, and a straight
//!   line of 2 nodes gets one in its middle.
//! - **Spacing.** Going along the line, a rung nearer than 1 mm to the last one kept is left out.
//! - **Each rung** is perpendicular to the line where it lies, 1.2 times the column's width long, and is
//!   kept only when it crosses each rail at exactly one point. It pairs those 2 points.
//!
//! A line whose offsets split, because it crosses itself or comes back near itself, or whose ends are
//! within a CSS pixel of each other, is cut in half by length, and each half made on its own, at most 20
//! times deep. The halves' rails are joined end to end, and a rung pairs the first points of the second
//! half's rails, where the halves meet. A half whose offsets still split after 20 cuts is left out, and
//! so is one whose offset vanishes to one side, where the line turns more tightly than the column is
//! wide. A stretch shorter than a CSS pixel is left out at once, since every half of it would be.
//!
//! The rails made stay the column's rails. Ink/Stitch tells rails from rungs again among the lines it
//! made, as among drawn subpaths, and sometimes takes rungs for rails (`DEV-SAT-007`).
//!
//! Before all this, a closed line is rolled to start in the middle of its first segment where a rung, a
//! CSS thousandth longer than the column is wide, crosses the stroke's edge exactly twice: away from where
//! the line meets itself or folds tight. A line that ends where it starts is then made to start and end
//! in the middle of its first segment, and its points are rounded to a ten-thousandth of a CSS pixel, the
//! points that then repeat left out. Ink/Stitch measures in CSS pixels, and these are its limits.
