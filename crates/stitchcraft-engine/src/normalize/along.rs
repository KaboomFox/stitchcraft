//! Distances along a polyline: where each of its points lies, measured along it from its start, the point
//! at any distance, and the distance of the point nearest a given one.
//!
//! Running stitches are placed by distance along a stroke, and a satin column's stitches by distance
//! along the sections of its rails between rungs, so both measure their polylines here. Distances are sums
//! of point-to-point distances, square roots and arithmetic only, so every platform measures the same
//! (`docs/src/design/determinism.md`).
