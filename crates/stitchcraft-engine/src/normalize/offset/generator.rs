//! The raw curves an offset is cut from: each side of a polyline moved out by a distance, its corners
//! joined, before anything decides which parts of it lie on the edge of the stroke.
//!
//! The rules here are those GEOS (the geometry library under shapely, and so under Ink/Stitch) follows,
//! learned from its published design and checked against its answers (`conformance/oracle/offset.py`):
//!
//! - **Simplifying.** Before offsetting a side, a corner where the line turns towards that side is
//!   dropped when it lies nearer than a hundredth of the distance to the corner kept before it: there the
//!   moved segments would cross and leave a small loop. GEOS also measures the corner against the line
//!   past it and the lines to the points between, which a corner that near the one before always passes.
//!   The first and last segment always stay.
//! - **Each segment** is moved sideways by the distance.
//! - **An outside corner** (turning away from the side) gets the join: a miter point where the moved
//!   segments' lines meet, unless it lies farther from the corner than the limit times the distance;
//!   then a bevel across at that distance (a limited miter), or a plain bevel when even that is too far.
//!   A round join is an arc of segments, each at most a 16th of a right angle, all of one length; a
//!   bevel joins the moved ends. Ends closer than a thousandth of the distance are one point, the first.
//! - **An inside corner** gets the point where the moved segments cross. When they do not cross, the
//!   curve goes from the first moved end towards the corner and back to the next moved start, along short
//!   closing segments that the stroke covers (1/81 of the way to the corner for round joins, half way
//!   for the others).
//! - **A turn back** along the same line is a half circle for round joins, and a step across for the
//!   others.
//! - Points closer than a ten-thousandth of the distance to the last one are left out.
//!
//! The ring around a whole polyline is the left side forward, a round cap around the end, the right side
//! backward and a round cap around the start, each side simplified on its own.
