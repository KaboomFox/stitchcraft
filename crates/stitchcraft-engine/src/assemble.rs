//! Pipeline stage 4 (plan assembly): the elements' stitch groups joined, in document order, into one stitch
//! plan, with the lock stitches, jumps, trims, stops and thread changes between them.
//!
//! Design: `docs/src/design/engine-pipeline.md` › Plan assembly. The needle sews straight on from one
//! group to the next only when nothing separates them: the same thread, a move no longer than the
//! collapse length (or the earlier element's `min_jump_stitch_length_mm`), no forced locks, no trim or
//! stop. Anything else ends the group with its tie-off and starts the next with a jump and its tie-in, as
//! `ties` allows ([`crate::locks`] sews them). That is where locks go, and the only place (`REQ-LCK-001`).
//!
//! The plan is built in the design's coordinates. Finalize moves it so the design's origin, or the centre
//! of its stitches, is at the hoop's centre (`REQ-ASM-005`), once it has left out the points the machine
//! cannot sew. What the machine cannot sew — a stitch too long or too short for it, a design too large for
//! the hoop — is finalize's to fix or report (M3.9).
