//! The StitchCraft parameter registry (layer L0).
//!
//! Every embroidery parameter is declared once, beside the generator that uses it, with [`params!`];
//! everything else that needs to know about parameters — typed structs, validation, reference docs, the
//! JSON Schema, and later VectorCraft plug-in manifests, CLI help, SVG attributes and property-test
//! strategies — is generated from that declaration. Design: `docs/src/design/params.md`.
//!
//! - [`StitchType`]: the stitch types, by their Ink/Stitch method ids.
//! - [`ParamSpec`], [`Kind`], [`ParamGroup`]: what the registry knows about each parameter.
//! - [`ParamSet`]: an element's parameters as its design stores them (text), read into typed views by
//!   each declaration's `from_set`, or `from_set_as` for an element of one stitch type, with `SC-E0101`,
//!   `SC-W0102` and `SC-W0105` for what is wrong ([`value`], [`set`]).
//! - [`audit()`]: what REQ-PRM-001 asks of every declaration, checked by the registry's own test.
//!
//! The registry itself — the list of every declaration — lives in `stitchcraft-engine`, next to the
//! generators: this crate knows no stitch algorithm.
