//! Work budgets: how StitchCraft guarantees that it finishes.
//!
//! An accidental or hostile input — a path with a million nodes, a fill with 0.001 mm row spacing —
//! must not make StitchCraft run for hours or exhaust memory, on the command line or inside
//! VectorCraft's five-second live-effect window. So every loop over input charges a [`Meter`], and when
//! the budget runs out the work stops with [`Exhausted`], which hosts report as `SC-E0004`
//! ([`Exhausted::diagnostic`]). Other elements still plan.
//!
//! Work is counted in abstract units (one per inner-loop iteration: a scanline crossing, a graph edge
//! visit, an offset step), never in time, so a budget behaves identically on every machine and the
//! result never depends on how fast the computer is (`docs/src/design/determinism.md`).
