//! Diagnostics: problems with the user's design, explained in their terms, with stable codes.
//!
//! A diagnostic is a value, not a failure: the engine collects diagnostics and keeps planning whatever
//! it can, and every host shows them the same way. Each carries a [`Code`] from the registry in this
//! module, the single source of truth for ids, severities, titles and explanations. `stitch explain`,
//! the generated diagnostics index and the VectorCraft plug-in's messages are all built from it, and
//! tests check every entry, so an error message cannot ship without ever having been rendered
//! (`docs/src/design/diagnostics.md`).
//!
//! Codes are never reused. A retired code stays registered, with "(retired)" in its title.
