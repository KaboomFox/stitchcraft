//! Machine embroidery formats (layer L2): PES (PEC) for Brother and DST for everything else.
//!
//! Writing a plan has two halves. Lowering (the `lower` module) does what every format needs — quantize each
//! position once, turn positions into moves, spell out colour changes and the end, check commands —
//! and each format module only decides how to *spell* those operations, respecting its own per-record
//! limits by splitting long moves evenly. Writers refuse rather than produce a file a machine could
//! misread: every failure is an [`EncodeError`] with a registered diagnostic code. What a format makes
//! the machine do that the plan does not say comes with the file ([`Encoded::notes`]): DST's machines
//! cut the thread before long jumps.
//!
//! Reading goes the other way: [`decode()`] recognises PES, PEC and DST by their first bytes, and each reader
//! treats the file as possibly damaged or hostile — every offset and length checked, records capped,
//! failures typed ([`DecodeError`]), never a panic. Design: `docs/src/design/formats.md`.
