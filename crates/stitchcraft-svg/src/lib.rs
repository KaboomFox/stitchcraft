//! SVG adapter (layer L3): SVG documents to the engine's design model.
//!
//! Hosts translate their documents into a [`Design`](stitchcraft_engine::design::Design), so the engine
//! never sees SVG (`docs/src/design/architecture.md` › Hosts, ports and adapters). This crate is the
//! translation for SVG files: [`read`] turns a file into a design and the warnings about what it left out
//! or simplified.
//!
//! What it reads (roadmap step M3.3): paths and the basic shapes, groups and `<switch>`, transforms, the
//! root's size and viewBox (so lengths come out in millimetres), fill and stroke colours with
//! `currentColor`, each shape's fill before its stroke, and everything that hides an element. Since M4.8
//! it reads each stroke's width and join, and Ink/Stitch's design settings in the file's metadata. Of
//! Ink/Stitch's own objects it knows enough not to stitch them: command symbols and their connectors,
//! connector-tool lines and helper paths are left out; trim and stop commands, and the ignore commands and
//! setting, are applied. It reads style sheets as editors write them, with element, class and id
//! selectors (`REQ-SVG-006`). The other `inkstitch:*` settings, commands, clones and clip paths follow in
//! milestone M8.
//!
//! Its invariants:
//!
//! - **It never fails on content.** Any path data, degenerate arcs included, is read the way SVG viewers
//!   draw it (`REQ-SVG-002`, fuzzed); only a file that is not SVG at all, or whose size cannot be read, is
//!   refused (`SC-E0801`).
//! - **Nothing is dropped silently.** What it leaves out or simplifies is a warning (`SC-W0802`,
//!   `SC-W0804`), unless a viewer would not show it either.
//! - **Positions are exact** to well within a micrometre (`REQ-SVG-001`), and the same on every platform:
//!   transforms are built with `stitchcraft_core::math`, not the platform's trigonometry.
//! - **Work is bounded** by the file size limit, the XML node limit and the budget.
