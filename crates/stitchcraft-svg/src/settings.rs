//! Ink/Stitch's design settings: the settings it keeps for the whole design rather than for one element
//! (`REQ-SVG-005`).
//!
//! Ink/Stitch writes 3 of them into the file's first `<metadata>` element, wherever that is: each is an
//! element of Ink/Stitch's namespace named after the setting, its text the value as JSON, such as
//! `<inkstitch:collapse_len_mm>3</inkstitch:collapse_len_mm>`. It reads the first element of each name
//! among that element's children, and nothing else. The values are millimetres, and they become the
//! design's [`DesignSettings`]. Read at Ink/Stitch `d59c9ab`: `lib/metadata.py`, `lib/utils/settings.py`.
//!
//! A value that is not a number of 0 or more is ignored, and the design keeps its default; the document
//! reader names it (`SC-W0802`). Ink/Stitch takes text that is not JSON as unset, and so uses its default
//! too, but it sews a negative number as it is. A file without a setting has StitchCraft's default, which
//! is Ink/Stitch's own unless the person sewing it has changed theirs in Ink/Stitch's preferences.
