//! Ink/Stitch's own objects in a drawing: its commands, the connectors that tie them to objects, and its
//! helper paths. None of them is part of the design.
//!
//! Ink/Stitch keeps some of its controls in the drawing itself, as objects a viewer draws. Read as plain
//! SVG they would be stitched: a line from each command's symbol to its object, the guide lines that steer
//! other shapes' stitches, and even the templates a file asks to leave out. Ink/Stitch never stitches
//! them, and neither does StitchCraft. Read at Ink/Stitch `d59c9ab`: `lib/commands.py`,
//! `lib/elements/utils/nodes.py`, `lib/marker.py`.
//!
//! - **Commands** are `<use>` elements that show a `<symbol>` whose id is `inkstitch_` and the command's
//!   name; a symbol copied between files may add `-` and a number. A command for one object is tied to
//!   it by a connector, a path whose `inkscape:connection-start` and `inkscape:connection-end` name the
//!   `<use>` and the object, either way round. Layer and document commands stand alone. A `<use>` of any
//!   other symbol is an ordinary clone.
//! - **Connectors**, paths with those attributes or with `inkscape:connector-type`, are never stitched.
//!   One that ties no command (drawn with Inkscape's connector tool) is reported.
//! - **Helper paths** carry one of Ink/Stitch's own start markers in their `style` attribute: a guide
//!   line, an anchor line or a stitch pattern. They steer the stitches of other shapes and are not
//!   stitched themselves; StitchCraft does not apply them yet, and says so.
//! - **Leaving out.** The `ignore_object` command, or the `inkstitch:ignore_object` setting, leaves out an
//!   object and everything in it; an `ignore_layer` command leaves out every layer it is in. Each is
//!   listed (`SC-I0805`).
//!
//! The other commands: `trim` and `stop` turn on the object's `trim_after` and `stop_after`, exactly as
//! the settings would. `starting_point` and `ending_point` place where Ink/Stitch starts and ends a fill
//! or a satin column; they, `origin` and `stop_position` are not applied yet (`SC-W0802`). `target_point`
//! aims circular fills and ripples, which StitchCraft does not sew yet, and the rest feed Ink/Stitch's own
//! tools, so they change nothing StitchCraft sews.
