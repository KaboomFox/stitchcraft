StitchCraft brings machine embroidery to VectorCraft, ArtCraft's open-source Illustrator, as sandboxed
WebAssembly plug-ins plus a command-line tool. It sews running and bean stitch, satin columns with
underlay, and tatami, contour, meander and circular fills, among other stitch types. It reads the
embroidery parameters Ink/Stitch stores in SVG files, so designs move between the tools.

How it is built:

- **Never crashes.** Every file and parameter is untrusted input; no panics, no `unsafe`, bounded work,
  and every problem is a coded diagnostic with an explanation page.
- **Deterministic.** The same design produces the same file on Linux, macOS, Windows and the web.
- **Proven.** Behaviour is specified as numbered requirements and checked by a conformance suite on every
  pull request — and sewn on a real Brother machine at every milestone.
- **Docs that cannot drift.** Parameter, diagnostic, CLI and profile references and the pictures in the
  docs are generated from the code and regenerated in CI.
- **Survives VectorCraft releases.** The plug-in is tested daily against VectorCraft's stable releases,
  pre-releases, its `release` branch and `main`.

## Status

StitchCraft sews the strokes of an SVG design in running stitch, bean stitch or manual stitch, with lock
stitches, trims and stops, and writes PES and DST files. It reads, draws and converts PES, PEC and DST
files from other software. The engine sews satin columns, their underlays first, then their top stitches
with compensation, short stitches and split stitches. The rest of milestone M4 decides where a column
starts and ends, and sews columns drawn as a centre line. An SVG's satin columns are sewn once `stitch
plan` reads Ink/Stitch's settings, in M8. Fills come in M5.
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) is the status board.

## Use it

Build the `stitch` command from source ([install](docs/src/user/install.md)), then plan a design:

```sh
stitch plan design.svg -o design.pes --preview design.png
```

The [user guide](https://kaboomfox.github.io/stitchcraft/dev/user/) has tutorials, how-to guides and a
page for each stitch type.

## Browser build

Run StitchCraft inside VectorCraft on the web with the [browser build](web/README.md).
The Web workflow publishes the editor and embroidery plug-ins to GitHub Pages, with a preview link
for each trusted pull request.

## Quick start (developers)

```sh
cargo xtask ci                      # all gates
cargo test --workspace              # tests only
cd docs && mdbook serve             # the documentation site, live
```

## Workspace

`crates/{stitchcraft-core, stitchcraft-params, stitchcraft-plan, stitchcraft-engine,
stitchcraft-formats, stitchcraft-render, stitchcraft-svg, stitchcraft-vectorcraft, stitchcraft-testkit}`
and `apps/{stitchcraft-cli, stitchcraft-vc-plugin}`, layered and enforced by `cargo xtask layers`.
